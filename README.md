# web-test
Sample Web Application (NetBeans Generator)

## NetBeans Generated Project 
This project only serves demonstration purposes for students. The overall application is generated from the sample database delivered with [Payara 5](https://www.payara.fish/ "Payara Server") and [NetBeans 8.2](https://netbeans.org/downloads/ "NetBeans All"). 

It is not really intended for development, but to illustrate how to use NetBeans for web application development and how to hook up with GitHub.

## HowTo interact with GitHub
Besides utilizing the command line, NetBeans offers to develop a project, initialize a Git repository and then just push it to GitHub (just copy the URL to your GitHub repository). Further information about NetBeans and Git is also given [here](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html).
